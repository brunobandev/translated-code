# Productivity Tips For Programmers
***6 tips that help you maximize productivity***

“Focus on being productive instead of being busy.” It’s a quote from Tim Ferriss that sums it up pretty well. Although we would like to think being busy and being productive are the same thing, more often than not they’re not.

It’s easy to look or feel busy as a programmer, without actually accomplishing much. Spending way too much time reading through emails or on repetitive tasks isn’t bringing much value.

Whenever you’re being productive you get done quality work which helps you finishing important tasks or get closer towards a goal. Being busy on the other hand means you aren’t allowing yourself much free time because you’re constantly trying to work on too many things — regardless of the fact whether they’re productive or not.

A busy person can spend days with nothing tangible to show for their time and effort. You don’t want to be that person that’s just busy. How can you get more productive as a programmer instead of just being busy?

## Tip 1. Know When to Walk Away From Your Computer

Coding can get intense especially when you end up coding for multiple hours straight. It’s inevitable that you stare at your screen from time to time not knowing how to solve the problem that you’re facing.

As said before, productivity doesn’t equal hours spend behind the keyboard. Staring at your screen for too long will give you a false sense of productivity since you’re busy but you still don’t get anything done.

Clear your head for a few minutes and refresh your focus. Stretch your legs or get something to drink. You will find out you’re able to solve problems more quickly.

You’ll find that the solution to a lot of hard problems suddenly pops up in your head while you’re doing some other mundane task. Whenever you find yourself staring at your screen again, walk away. It will most likely help you!

## Tip 2. Spend Time Learning New Tools

The tools you use define the way you work. Besides mastering the tools you use, you should spend time learning new tools.

Developers have unique needs depending on their focus area. There is no list of tools every developer needs. The tools you need are different for every developer. For a large part it depends on your tech stack, a Java developer uses different tools than a Python developer. And even if the tech stack is the same each developer has its own preference, of course.

You need to put in some time to find out which tools you are available and which tools you like the most.

The goal is to always be looking for tools that could reduce the amount of manual and repetitive work as possible. This brings us to the following tip.

## Tip 3. Automate as Much as You Can

As with most jobs, some things tend to be very repetitive. Programming is definitely no exception to this. In fact, programming is probably one of the jobs where you could automate most of your repetitive tasks.

Automating as many things as you can helps you spend less time doing manual and time-costly things. Of course, you initially have to spend some time creating the script to automate a certain task but in the long run this will pay itself off.

This isn’t just because you could save some minutes due to the fact you don’t have to do a certain task manually. What also matters is that you don’t need to break your focus to do some boring task you have done infinitely.

Automation helps you to focus on the bigger tasks by taking care of the monotonous ones.

## Tip 4. Work on Your Most Important Task First

Your most important task is a critical responsibility that will create the most essential results you’re looking to achieve. All tasks on your plate are not critically important, so don’t treat them like they are the same.

> Identify your most important task and do it first.

That’s all it takes.

Next, you need to have the discipline of scheduling time to work on your most important task. Work on that task first thing in the morning. I can’t emphasize this enough. Behavioral psychologists say we are at our best for about a two-hour window of time in the morning.

Stop working on everybody else’s most important task in this window of time by answering their emails and phone calls, for example. Finish your most important task before answering all these emails and phone calls.

## Tip 5. Create a Plan Before Writing Code

Creating a plan before you start writing code keeps you focused. As a result, you know exactly what to build and how you want to approach solving the problem. This allows you to not let your thoughts drift away or add some unnecessary features you think might be useful in the future.

Before you even think about coding you should make sure you understand all the requirements. To build or fix something you have to understand what you’re supposed to code.

The smallest details can have a huge impact on the solution you’re looking to implement so you should really understand the requirements.

Once you’ve done this, you can start making a plan which you can do by breaking your problem or feature down in smaller pieces.

Think about the problems you’re going to face and research all that’s needed. While you might get away with not planning when working on a small application, for larger applications not planning has a big negative effect.

## Tip 6. Cut Yourself Off From Social Media

The last, but definitely, not least tip to increase your productivity is cutting yourself off from social media. Social media is a big distraction. And for some reason, we tend to check it every 10 minutes to see if we’re not missing out on something. Only to find out nothing interesting happened.

If you aren’t careful social media can suck up a lot of your precious time. Every time you’re distracted by social media it takes time to get back your focus and in the meantime nothing gets done easily.

This is arguably the tip that could increase your productivity the most — depending on your social media habits. The best part about this tip is that it can be applied without much effort.

## Quick Recap
Productivity gains come with time, so don’t expect to see massive productivity gains in the short term. Focus on one item on this list at a time and you will see yourself get more productive over time.

These are the 6 things you could do in order to become more productive:

1. Know when to walk away from your computer
2. Spend time learning new tools
3. Automate as much as you can
4. Work on your most important task first
5. Create a plan before you start writing code
6. Cut yourself off from social media
